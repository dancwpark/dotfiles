# Quick rundown on nvim usage
Generally using nvim for all text editing within one instance.

## General
`ctrl+n`: open up NERDTree
`ctrl+w h/j/k/l/up/down/left/right`: move window
`gt`: cycle tab
`gT`: previous tab
`#gt`: go to # tab


## NERDTree
`m`: file options
`m -> a`: new file
`i`: open file with horizontal split
`s`: open file with verticla split
`t`: open file in new tab


## TODO
[] May remove some custom tmux bindings and use for nvim
  * `ctrl+w [direction]` is a lot of work
